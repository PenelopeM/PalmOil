-> "In 2004, WWF, AAK, KLK, Sainsbury’s, Unilever and others established the RSPO, a non-profit initiative which today brings together more than 500 palm oil growers, oil processors, manufacturers, retailers, NGOs and palm oil investors, who have one goal in common—promoting the growth and use of sustainable oil palm. The RSPO has set a strict standard for responsible oil palm plantations, coupled with an independent system for auditing plantations, mills and the supply chain right up to the end users, like the manufacturers and retailers in this Scorecard."
